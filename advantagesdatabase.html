    <td>Data independence</td>
    <td>In a database system the data is held independently of the application programs that use it. 
	Changes to the data or the way it is stored will not necessarily affect the programs that use the data. </td>

    <td>Data sharing</td>
    <td>The collection of data in a central data repository and managed by a DBMS allows the data to
	be shared by several users and applications.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Reduced maintenance</td>
    <td>A number of tools for maintaining the data are already built in to most DBMS.
