<h2> This is the main page for data bases system and A database can be defined as a shared collection of interrelated data designed to meet
 the varied information needs of an organisation. (McFadden and Hoffer).</h2>
<h2>There are five major components in a database environment: data, hardware, software, people and procedures. The data is a collection of facts,
 typically related. The hardware consists of the physical devices in the database environment. Operating systems, 
 database management systems and applications make up the software. Examples of people in the database environment are the system administrator,
 programmers and end users. Procedures are the written instructions and rules for the database to function by.</h2>
 <h2>A database consists of:</h2>
 <h2>Database structure Which is conceived as a single entity consisting of a collection of interrelated files.
   Repository Which contains the rules under which users can access the data and the rules under which the data is organised ie metadata.</h2>
 <h2>End users Who access the database.</h2>
 <h2>Interfaces Which are the various ways an end user may access the data via display terminals, phone links from remote terminals,
 touch screens, bar code readers, by using voice commands, touch pads, graphics selection, selections from menus with keyboard or mouse, 
 keying in commands or scanning cards.  The interface also is the form 
 in which the information is delivered to the end user eg graph, printed report, graphical display.</h2>
<h2>Application programs 	Which are used to perform the main operations on the data ie create, modify, delete and retrieve. 
 Application programs also combine the data in meaningful ways to produce reports.</h2>
<h2>Database Management System (DBMS) 	Which is the collection of programs that manages the database structure and 
interprets the rules in the repository and also manages user access in multi-user systems.</h2> 
<h2>Computer Aided Software Engineering Tools (CASE tools) 	Are also considered to be part of the database environment.
These are automated tools to assist with the design of systems and databases.</h2>
<h2>Database Administrators (DBA) 	Manage the DBMS and are responsible for the overall information resources of an organisation.  
You will look at the role of the DBA more fully in a later section.</h2>
<h2>System Developers 	Include systems analysts and programmers.
 You will look at the role of each of these in other modules. Both use CASE tools to assist in the development of application programs.</h2>
